## 📊 What Gets Stored

### After Registration

```javascript
User Document:
{
  name: "Test User",
  email: "testuser@owner.com",
  role: "owner",
  fingerprintTemplateId: "bio_1234567890_abcdef123",
  biometricData: {
    fingerprint: "bio_1234567890_abcdef123",
    lastEnrolled: "2026-04-09T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### After Vehicle Sale

```javascript
Request Document:
{
  type: "newRegistration",
  dealer: { _id: "dealer123", name: "ABC Motors" },
  buyer: { _id: "buyer456", name: "John Doe" },
  biometricVerification: {
    dealer: {
      templateId: "bio_dealer_template_123",
      quality: 94,
      timestamp: "2026-04-09T10:30:00.000Z"
    },
    buyer: {
      templateId: "bio_buyer_template_456",
      quality: 91,
      timestamp: "2026-04-09T10:30:10.000Z"
    },
    matchVerified: true
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Modal Doesn't Appear

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify component imports are correct
- Ensure state variables are properly initialized

### Animation Stuck

- Check browser dev tools → Performance tab
- Verify CSS animations are loading
- Try refreshing the page

### Biometric Always Fails

- Check success rate in `BiometricCaptureModal.tsx` line 80
- Current: `Math.random() > 0.05` (95% success)
- Change to `Math.random() > 0` for 100% success during testing

### Slow Performance

- Reduce animation durations in component
- Decrease scanning interval from 60ms to 100ms
- Reduce positioning delay from 2000ms to 1000ms

## 🎬 Demo Script for Presentation

### Introduction (30 seconds)

```
"Today I'll demonstrate our biometric simulation system that provides
a realistic fingerprint capture experience for all user roles."
```

### Registration Demo (1 minute)

```
1. "First, let's register a new user..."
2. Fill form quickly
3. "After submitting, notice the biometric enrollment..."
4. Point out: blurred background, card UI, animations
5. "The system captures the fingerprint and stores a secure template"
```

### Vehicle Sale Demo (2 minutes)

```
1. "Now as a dealer, let's sell a vehicle..."
2. Fill vehicle details
3. "Here's where biometrics ensure security..."
4. "First, the dealer verifies..." (show dealer capture)
5. "Then, the buyer verifies..." (show buyer capture)
6. "The system matches both biometrics..." (show verification)
7. "Only then is the transaction authorized"
```

### Ownership Transfer Demo (1 minute)

```
1. "Similarly, for second-hand sales..."
2. Show owner initiating transfer
3. "Same dual biometric verification ensures both parties consent"
4. "This prevents unauthorized transfers"
```

### Conclusion (30 seconds)

```
"This biometric system ensures:
- Every user is enrolled with fingerprint verification
- All transactions require dual-party authentication
- Complete audit trail for blockchain immutability
- Easy upgrade path to real STK hardware"
```

## 📝 Notes for Examiners/Guides

### Why Simulation Mode?

- Real biometric STK hardware costs ₹15,000-₹50,000
- Requires physical device and SDK licenses
- Simulation demonstrates the complete flow
- Production-ready code structure (easy to swap)

### Security Features

1. **Template Storage**: Encrypted fingerprint templates (not images)
2. **Quality Scoring**: Ensures good biometric capture
3. **Match Verification**: Both parties must verify
4. **Audit Trail**: All biometric events logged
5. **Blockchain Ready**: Templates can be hashed and stored on-chain

### Real-World Applicability

- RTO offices use biometric for all vehicle registrations
- Prevents identity fraud and impersonation
- Creates tamper-proof ownership records
- Complies with Digital India initiative
