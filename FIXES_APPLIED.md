# 🔧 Fixes Applied - Owner Dashboard Buttons

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ RC & Blockchain Button

**Problem:** Button wasn't working or showing any feedback when clicked.

**Solution:**

- Added check for `blockchainTxHash` before opening Polygonscan
- Shows alert if blockchain registration is pending
- Added visual feedback with opacity change when disabled
- Added "Blockchain Status" column to show status at a glance

**Now Shows:**

- ✅ **"On Blockchain"** badge (green) - if transaction hash exists
- ⏳ **"Pending RTO"** badge (orange) - if awaiting RTO approval

### 2. ✅ View History Button

**Problem:** Getting 404 error because API expected registration number, not vehicle ID.

**Solution:**

- Changed from `fetchVehicleHistory(vehicleId)` to `fetchVehicleHistory(vehicleId, regNumber)`
- Now passes `regNumber` to the correct API endpoint: `/vehicles/history/:regNumber`
- Shows helpful alert if registration number not assigned yet
- Changed button color to warning (orange) for better visibility

### 3. ✅ RC Card Button

**Status:** Already working correctly!

- Navigates to `/rc-card/:vehicleId` route
- Shows beautiful RC certificate card

## 📊 Updated UI:

### My Vehicles Table Columns:

```
Reg No | Make & Model | Year | Status | Blockchain Status | Actions
```

### Action Buttons (in order):

1. 🔗 **RC & Blockchain** (Green) - Opens Polygonscan transaction page
2. 📄 **RC Card** (Blue) - Opens RC certificate view
3. 💰 **Sell** (Primary) - Initiate vehicle sale
4. 📜 **View History** (Orange/Warning) - View ownership history

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now:

### Scenario 1: Vehicle Registered by Dealer, Pending RTO Approval

```
Blockchain Status: ⏳ Pending RTO
RC & Blockchain Button: Disabled (opacity 0.5), shows alert when clicked
Message: "Blockchain registration pending. This vehicle hasn't been registered on blockchain yet."
```

### Scenario 2: Vehicle Approved by RTO (On Blockchain)

```
Blockchain Status: ✅ On Blockchain (green badge)
RC & Blockchain Button: Enabled, opens Polygonscan when clicked
URL: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/tx/{blockchainTxHash}
```

### Scenario 3: View Ownership History

```
Click "📜 View History" →
If regNumber exists: Fetches and displays ownership history table
If no regNumber: Shows alert "Registration number not assigned yet."
```

## 🔍 Backend API Endpoints Used:

```javascript
✅ GET /api/vehicles/my              // Get all my vehicles
✅ GET /api/vehicles/:id             // Get single vehicle by ID
✅ GET /api/vehicles/history/:regNumber  // Get ownership history
```

## 💡 Visual Improvements:
